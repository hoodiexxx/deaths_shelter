# Toronto Shelter Analysis: A Deep Dive of  Shelter Total Decedents with Features in Real Life

## Overview

This project investigates the seasonal patterns and the deaths of homeless individuals within Torontoâ€™s shelter system between 2007 and 2024. The analysis draws on publicly available data from Open Data Toronto to understand how factors such as seasonal weather changes, the COVID-19 pandemic, and systemic public health conditions contribute to the mortality rate among shelter residents. The study aims to provide insights for policy recommendations, especially regarding improving shelter conditions and targeted public health interventions for vulnerable populations.
